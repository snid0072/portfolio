# portfolio

## Process
I started by designing wireframes and mockups for the layout of my portfolio using Figma. After finalizing the design, I implemented it using HTML and the Bootstrap framework. I made sure to optimize for responsiveness and accessibility.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was ensuring my website is both responsive across different devices and accessible to all users. I tackled this by using Bootstrap's grid system and focusing on proper semantic HTML. I also had to work on an extreme time crunch and so my website is very plain. But personally I'd like my website plain anyways.
